## 1. AXI Stream

---
## 2. Bloom Filter

---
## 3. Master packet dealer

#### `mpd_base` - V1 of Master packet dealer
- base version of Master packet dealer with `MPD` module logic without `AXI stream` and other module integration

- ##### Advancements to be done in the next version:
    - Refinement of `MPD`'s FSM.
    - Addition of `AXI stream` to the `MPD` module.
    

---
## 4. Packet Reference Table

#### `prt_base` - V1 of packet reference table.
- PRT with all the FSM states was written and the `base version` is been tested with `prt_tb_1.sv` and `prt_tb_2.sv` **(refer testbench log for testbench related queries)**

---
#### `prt_v2` - V2 with Improvements of packet reference table.
- <span style="color:red;">ðŸš¨ coverage and stuffs are YTBD</span>
- <span style="color:red;">ðŸš¨ Error: IMPLEMENTATION IS FAILING</span>
- <span style="color:orange; font-weight:bold;"> âš  `prt_v3` is fixed as release module as of now.</span>

- ##### Implementation :
    <img alt="Implementation" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Implementation-FAIL-red"> 

    - **Cause:** Junction temperature exceeded to `103Â°c` due to excessicve resource utilization

- ### Advancements done in this version.
    - **handshake** mechanism is introduced (by this way, unconditional running is avoided)
    - **Optimization of FSM :** FSM is neatly & efficietly optimised.

- ### YTBD improvements.
    - **BRAM** should be implemented for efficient memory access.
    - **Dual port** concept should be implemented for sequential data access <span style="color:red;">(note: in this version, it's a one person at a time communication)</span>

- ### Advancemens done in this version
    - **BRAM** is introduced for the memory addess.
    - **Dual port** concept must be inplemented in `ethernet_transactor` and not in `prt` or `mpd` module <span style = "color:red;"> (this was notified only on 12, Mar)       (Explanation must be given by CP) </span> 
    - `Resource utilization` has been brought down by impllementing `BRAM`

<br><span style = "color:red;"> All the improvements that is said by `Nithish` has been implemented and the things that are not done have a **valid** reason</span> 

<span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-size: 17px;">
    PRT module has been completed and Implementation was done on <code>13, March</code>
