## 4. Packet Reference Table

### `prt_base` - base version of packet reference table.
- PRT with all the FSM states was written and the `base version` is been tested with `prt_tb_1.sv` and `prt_tb_2.sv` **(refer testbench log for testbench related queries)**




### `prt_v2` - Version 2 with Improvements of packet reference table.

- ### Advancements done in this version.
    - **handshake** mechanism is introduced (by this way, unconditional running is avoided)
    - **Optimization of FSM :** FSM is neatly & efficietly optimised.

- ### YTBD improvements.
    - **BRAM** should be implemented for efficient memory access.
    - **Dual port** concept should be implemented for sequential data access <span style="color:red;">(note: in this version, it's a one person at a time communication)</span>
